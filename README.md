# foobar2000\_drag\_drop\_play
A plugin for Foobar2000 audio player that plays music instantly after drag and drop

By default, when you drag/drop an mp3 file onto Foobar2000, it gets added to the end of the playlist - but with this plugin, if you drag/drop an mp3 file, it will begin playing instantly.

How to install:

1.   Download [foo_dragdropplay.zip](https://github.com/moltenform/foobar2000_drag_drop_play/releases/download/v1.0/foo_dragdropplay.zip).
2.   Unzip the zip file and copy `foo_dragdropplay.dll` to the 'components' folder next to foobar2000.exe.
3.   Start foobar2000.
4.   From the View menu, click DragDropPlay. Some text will appear indicating that the plugin in active.

You can now drag/drop a song and it will begin playing instantly. To temporarily turn off the plugin, close the window that says DragDropPlay.

How to compile (optional): Install Visual Studio Community (a free download), and use its C++ compiler. Thanks to Holger Stenger for his foobar2000 plugin tutorial.
