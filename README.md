# foobar2000_drag_drop_play
A plugin for Foobar2000 audio player that plays music instantly after drag and drop

How to install:

1.   Download [foo_dragdropplay.zip](https://github.com/downpoured/foobar2000_drag_drop_play/releases/download/v1.0-beta/foo_dragdropplay.zip).
2.   Unzip the archive and copy foo_dragdropplay.dll to the 'components' folder next to foobar2000.exe.
3.   Start foobar2000.
4.   From the View menu, select DragDropPlay.

You can now drag/drop a song on the end of a playlist and it will start right away.
To turn this off, close the DragDropPlay window.

If building from source, use foo_dragdropplay.sln. I use the free MSVS Community 2013, other VS may work. Thanks to Holger Stenger for the foobar2000 plugin tutorial.
