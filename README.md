# foobar2000\_drag\_drop\_play
A plugin for Foobar2000 audio player that plays music instantly after drag and drop

When you drag/drop a song, Foobar2000 adds it to the current playlist instead of playing it. With this plugin, you can now drag/drop a song and it will begin playing instantly.

How to install:

1.   Download [foo_dragdropplay.zip](https://github.com/moltenform/foobar2000_drag_drop_play/releases/download/v1.0-beta/foo_dragdropplay.zip).
2.   Unzip the zip file and copy `foo_dragdropplay.dll` to the 'components' folder next to foobar2000.exe.
3.   Start foobar2000.
4.   From the View menu, click DragDropPlay. Some text will appear indicating that the plugin in active.

You can now drag/drop a song and it will begin playing instantly. To temporarily turn off the plugin, close the window that says DragDropPlay.

To compile from source code, it's easiest to install Visual Studio Community, which is a free download, and use its C++ compiler. Thanks to Holger Stenger for his foobar2000 plugin tutorial.
